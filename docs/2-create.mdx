# Mint Your Character In 3 Mins

Your character is where your story will start. All subsequent social activities in the Crossbell world are tied to your character.

Besides... it's an NFT! 

## 1. Connect to Crossbell

First, let's connect to Crossbell!

Click the button below. You will be asked to connect to your wallet, and switch to the **Crossbell** chain.

import Connector from "../src/components/Connector/index.tsx";

<Connector />

<br />
<br />

## 2. Claim $CSB from the Faucet

On the Crossbell network, you need some $CSB to play with. Click the button below to see how much $CSB you have.

import CsbChecker from "./components/CsbChecker.tsx";

<CsbChecker />

<br />
<br />

Move on to the next step if you have enough $CSB (> 0).

## 3. Setup Your Profile

Here we go! The most exciting part - create your character on Crossbell!

import ProfileCreator from "./components/ProfileCreator.tsx";

<ProfileCreator />

<br />
<br />

## One More Thing - How about Developing?

Did you see how easy it was to create your character on Crossbell?

Not so surprisingly, it is also easy to **integrate Crossbell into your dapp** for developers!

See the code below for what happened behind the scenes using [crossbell.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crossbell.js) SDK:

```ts
import { Crossbell } from "crossbell.js";

// 1. Initialize Crossbell contract with an eth provider
const contract = new Contract(provider);

// 2. Connect to Crossbell
await contract.connect();

// 3. Create a profile
const result = await contract.createProfile(address, "my-profile-handle", "");
console.log(result.profileId); // the profile id
console.log(result.transactionHash); // the transaction hash

// Congratulations! You have created your profile!
```
