Not so surprisingly, it is also easy to **integrate Crossbell into your dapp** for developers!

See the code below for what happened behind the scenes using [crossbell.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crossbell.js) SDK:

```ts
import { Crossbell } from "crossbell.js";

// 1. Initialize Crossbell contract with an eth provider
const contract = new Contract(provider);

// 2. Connect to Crossbell
await contract.connect();

// 3. Create a profile
const result = await contract.createProfile(address, "my-profile-handle", "");
console.log(result.profileId); // the profile id
console.log(result.transactionHash); // the transaction hash

// Congratulations! You have created your profile!
```
