# About
> Cross-platform, ring a bell.

It is not only our nature as humans to socialize, but our right. We are born bearing the right to socialize with one another - without constraint from third parties. The idea seems simple, yet in most online settings these rights are nearly non-existent. Today, almost all social platforms are controlled by centralized organizations who collect (and sell) your data. Aside from the obvious security concerns, the data monopoly on current social platforms is simply an exploitation of us; the users.

Crossbell aims to change the landscape of how data is controlled and capitalized in social platforms.



## What is Crossbell?

Crossbell is an **ownership platform** composed of

1. an EVM-compatible blockchain
2. a protocol implemented by a set of smart contracts

Specifically, the information generated from **social activities** will be the initial form of data-capitalization on Crossbell.



## Why do we design Crossbell?

In Web2 networks, people enjoy an array of activities; from simple things such as liking and commenting on posts to more complicated financial activities. The abilities given to us through these Web2 platforms are great, the only problem is that we are ‘allowed’ to use them. This allowance can be taken away at any time, without reason.

This is where Crossbell becomes a game-changer: with a built-in capitalization design, Crossbell empowers users to take their data ownership back. On top of that, Crossbell is designed with an appreciation for information interoperability, meaning it is friendly for third-party applications to build on.
