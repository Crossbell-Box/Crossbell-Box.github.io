# Intro

## What is Crossbell?

Crossbell is an **information decentralization** platform composed of

1. an EVM-compatible Proof-of-Authority blockchain
2. a protocol implemented by a set of smart contracts

Specifically, the information generated from **social activities** is the first citizen on Crossbell.

> Cross-platform, ring a bell.

## Why do we design Crossbell?

In Web2 networks, people do enjoy various social activities, from commenting on a post to complicated financial activities. But honestly, we never own the data generated from those activities. Whether we could continuously enjoy these various social activities is not determined by us.

Crossbell is a game-rule changer here. With a **built-in decentralization** design, Crossbell empowers anyone to take their data ownership back. Furthermore, to amplify the beauty of information interoperability, the strong modularity and composability of Crossbell is friendly for third-party applications to build upon.
