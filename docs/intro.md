# Intro

## What is Crossbell?

Crossbell is a platform for **ownership** composed of

1. an EVM-compatible blockchain
2. a protocol implemented by a set of smart contracts

Specifically, we care the ownership of your **social activities** most.

> Cross-platform, ring a bell.

## Why do we design Crossbell?

In Web2 networks, people do enjoy various social activities, from commenting on a post to complicated financial activities. But honestly, we never own the data generated from those activities. Whether we could continuously enjoy these various social activities is not determined by us.

Crossbell is a game-rule changer here. With a **built-in tokenization** design, Crossbell empowers anyone to take their data ownership back. Furthermore, to amplify the beauty of information interoperability, the strong modularity and composability of Crossbell is friendly for third-party applications to build upon.
